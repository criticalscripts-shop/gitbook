# External Hosting Server

If you choose not to use the integrated proxy server then [download the external node.js application](https://github.com/criticalscripts-shop/cs-stories-ehs) and install it with `npm install`. Read through all options and their comments inside its `config.js` file as they are very important for the setup process, adjust them to your setup and preferences and then run it with `node`. Then make sure to add the external server's IP address in the `sv_proxyIPRanges` property in your server's configuration file. You can use [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) to make sure it runs all the time.
