# FiveM Hall

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZtYWaDabuY" %}

***

The resource comes with an **extensive configuration**, events, exports and **some client / server source files** to allow you to customize it to your liking.

It is a **standalone resource** and **works with any framework**. The UI is accessed via the _**/hall**_ command while inside an enabled hall location for players with Ace permission "_**cs-hall.control**_". This check and how the UI is accessed can be changed by modifying _**integration/client.lua**_ and _**integration/server.lua**_ files. There is also an identifier-based check in parallel to Ace permission which can also be edited in _**integration/server.lua**_ file to add any player identifiers you want. **You may also find some ready-to-use framework-related integrations** [**here**](https://github.com/criticalscripts-shop/extra-hac/tree/main/cs-hall/integration)**.**

Out of the box we provide you with configuration for the following locations (some of them are disabled by default, you can enable them in the configuration file).
